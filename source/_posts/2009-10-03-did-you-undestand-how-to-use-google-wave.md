title: "Did you understand how to use Google Wave?"
---

These last days we were all about Google Wave.
Twitter, Blogs and News were all round it, did you get an invite? No? I know, me too :)

So, yesterday I was thinking to watch the  so looooong video linked in the official Google Wave site:

<div class="videoWrapper">
  <iframe type="text/html" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v_UyVmITiYQ?autoplay=0"
    frameborder="0"></iframe>
</div>

That video is sooooooo long and if you still don't know how to use it well watch this:

<div class="videoWrapper">
  <iframe type="text/html" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rDu2A3WzQpo?autoplay=0"
    frameborder="0"></iframe>
</div>
