I've got interested in [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog) recently so I created a static blog generator.

Micro.blog asks you explicitly to provide a feed with your posts to generate the stream.

That means you need to generate and host a small RSS with the list of your articles.
And that's lovely! I like the idea to be in charge of my content in a such a low-level term.

Then what I did was put together some code and realize it might be useful to other people.

That was the moment Microsmith was born. You can find it at https://github.com/NKjoep/microsmith
