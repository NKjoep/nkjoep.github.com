### wtf css layout - TL;DR

When I started studying CSS I remember that the most difficult thing to understand
was figure out how to use those cool selectors and properties to properly
reproduce great page layouts.

There are several positioning methods you can approach, mastering them surely
would take you much time.

Tricky names impossible to remember and awful results.

I clearly remember that I wanted a quick guide, a reference where to learn the CSS
layout, but nothing was there. A guide developers from all over the world could
use and start doing their work: create the layout they need.

If you are a frontend developer, or if you worked with them before,
you probably would know that:

- **position** has strange values
- **fixed** really does not fix your problems
- **block** is the opposite of **inline**
- **margin** not always works
- **padding** and **width**, they just mess everything up
- **float** ... uh?

After few years of trying, creating static mockups, jsfiddles, pastebins and tons of
stackoverflow you probably will end up mastering all of them :)

I think *learnlayout.com* is a great resource, I know it will help future developers
to better understand the CSS and how to properly use it in order to achieve the desired layout.

*learnlayout.com* is straightforward, you can't ask for better examples or explanation.
Not even MDN is so clear.
