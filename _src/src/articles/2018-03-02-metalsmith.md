title: Move my posts to Metalsmith
---

How I dropped Jekyll in favour of Metalsmith. Seems <i>yesterday</i> I started with Jekyll.

I have started again the re-build of my website. It has always been a _Frankenstein_ rather than a finished job.
Completely dropped Jekyll (wasn't compiling anymore) and moved to the full-static-full-js Metalsmith.

The experiment continues.
